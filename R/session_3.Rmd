## Rmd Challenge

*To get quick reference (help --\> md quick ref, will show up in help window)*

top header is called YAML (yet another markdown language)

can customize in header

| Col1   | Col2      | Col3         |
|--------|-----------|--------------|
| Part 1 | Tea       | Coffee       |
| Part 2 | Spaghetti | Tacos        |
| Part 3 | Costco    | Trader Joe's |

# header 1

## header 2

### header 3

#### header 4

# schedule

1.  make coffee
2.  eat food
3.  take a nap

# schedule unstructured

-   make coffee
-   eat food
-   take a nap

visual editor works well (A/compass symbol in UL)

To insert citation, insert --\> citation (get doi)

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

## Create new chunk
keyboard shortcut (mac = command+alt+i, windows = ctrl+alt+i)

include = false (no code, no result)
echo = false (no code, yes result)

challenge results
  - copy + paste into console (fig shows up in plots window)


  - command return - shows up in box below chunk
  - green arrow - shows up in box below chunk

```{r new chunk}
library(ggplot2)
library(tidyr)

ggplot(data = cars,
       mapping = aes(x = speed, y = dist)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  geom_smooth(method = 'lm') + 
  theme_classic()
  
```
